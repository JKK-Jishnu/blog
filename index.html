      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I prefer to designate myself as an Engineer, although in my youth, I
        yearned to become a Scientist. A Scientist whose creations dazzled the
        world. During my formative years, I was an avid bibliophile. The
        unfolding of my existence took on a captivating turn when I successfully
        secured admission to a small college, fighting tooth and nail through a
        pre-university merit system. It was there that I had the opportunity to
        mingle with individuals from diverse strata of society and learned to
        differentiate between excellent and subpar resources. Despite its
        apparent simplicity, once you are able to identify reliable resources,
        life takes on a new meaning. If my recollection serves me correctly, Jio
        was launched during my third year of college. To borrow a phrase from
        Naval Ravikant, we live in a world with infinite leverage, and knowledge
        started exploding around me from that point forward. Following the
        completion of my studies, I worked as a service engineer in GCC for two
        years, primarily engaged in travelling and interacting with a wide range
        of people. I refer to this period as my "exposure" phase. Subsequently,
        I left my job and returned to India, travelling to several locations
        before ultimately settling in Bengaluru, the Mecca of Indian
        engineering, which boasts excellent weather, particularly for those
        hailing from this subcontinent.
