Here I present a collection of notes/snippets/ideas which I think is high quality.
Original ideas are generated when someone understand something extremely well which is a byproduct of curiocity and curiocity only.
All others are mostly a mimic in one form or another.

# on startup tech architecture

```
The most valuable lesson that we learned over the years is that you have to move fast.
This applies especially to the early stages of product development.
You will almost certainly be wrong about how exactly your product and its
features will be received by users. Few ideas will actually end up being
successful, at least at first. In that sense, having a high degree of flexibility
also means: Whatever you build should be cheap enough to be thrown overboard
in case it's not adapted by users, but solid enough so it can be easily
improved and built upon in case it is a success. The goal is to spend as little
time as possible
working on unverified features so that you have as much time as possible to follow
up on the ones that your users love.
